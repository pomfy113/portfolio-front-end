              <p>Hello, my name is Ferdinand Cruz! I'm a full-stack web developer,
                  and my strengths lie in front-end web development and scripting.
                  I'm motivated by making hobbies more convenient for others!
              </p>
              <p>I graduated from UC Davis with a B.A. in Psychology. After graduation,
                  I pursued the Full-Stack Web Development program at Make School, a Y.C.
                  backed college alternative for those who wish to enter the software
                  engineering field by shipping live products alongside traditional
                  lectures.</p>
              <p>I hope to work somewhere with challenging problems, a fun
                  atmosphere, and a product that many can use. I'm capable of
                  learning rather quickly and wearing many hats!
              </p>
              <p><u>Hobbies</u>: Video Games (MMORPGs, strategy RPGs, fighting),
                  Tabletop Roleplaying Games, Writing, Anime, Martial Arts
              </p>
